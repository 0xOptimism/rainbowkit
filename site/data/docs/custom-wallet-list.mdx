# Custom Wallet List

## Customising the wallet list

> ⚠️ Note: This API is unstable and likely to change in the near future. We recommend sticking with the built-in themes for now.

The following wallet options are presented by default via the getDefaultWallets function:

- Rainbow
- WalletConnect
- Coinbase Wallet
- MetaMask

An "Injected Wallet" fallback is also provided if `window.ethereum` exists and hasn't been provided by another wallet.

All built-in wallets are available via the `wallet` object which allows you to rearrange/omit wallets as needed.

```tsx
import { wallet, Wallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

const needsInjectedWalletFallback =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
  window.ethereum &&
  !window.ethereum.isMetaMask &&
  !window.ethereum.isCoinbaseWallet;

const wallets: Wallets = [
  {
    groupName: 'Suggested',
    wallets: [
      wallet.rainbow({ chains, infuraId }),
      wallet.walletConnect({ chains, infuraId }),
      wallet.coinbase({
        chains,
        appName: 'My RainbowKit App',
        jsonRpcUrl: ({ chainId }) =>
          chains.find(x => x.id === chainId)?.rpcUrls?.[0] ??
          chain.mainnet.rpcUrls[0],
      }),
      wallet.metaMask({ chains, infuraId }),
      ...(needsInjectedWalletFallback
        ? [wallet.injected({ chains, infuraId })]
        : []),
    ],
  },
];
```
